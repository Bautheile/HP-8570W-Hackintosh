# How to Install macOS Catalina

First of all, you need an already working Mac with supported Specs (check Apple's website). Download the latest version of Catalina from the App Store and use this command:

sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Catalina.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume

After it is done copy the EFI folder to the EFI partition and install as usual. After it is installed mount the EFI of the installed OS and copy the EFI folder to its partition.

If you want an OOTB-WiFi:
You need to change your WiFi card to get your internet working. Buy it on eBay or on your trustworthy website and find a suitable card with the kexts.
